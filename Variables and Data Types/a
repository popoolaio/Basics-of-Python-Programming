# Variable

## Dynamic Typing:
```Python
x = 10          # Integer
name = "Alice"  # String
pi = 3.14       # Float
is_active = True  # Boolean
```

## Reassignment:
```Python
x = 10      # Integer
x = "Ten"   # Now a String
```

## Descriptive Names:
```Python
user_age = 25
total_price = 100.50
```

## Naming Conventions:
- Use descriptive names to make your code readable
```Python
user_age = 25
total_price = 100.50
```
- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore _, but cannot start with a number.
- Avoid using reserved keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names.
- Use snake_case for multi-word variable names (e.g., user_name, total_amount).
